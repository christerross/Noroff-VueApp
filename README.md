I had some troubles when doing the different lessons. I got a couple of errors on the Advanced Vue.js Application Lesson and on the Creating a smart vue application. I focused on completing the lessons before starting on the pratical tasks in the module assignments. I figured that I wouldent get much done without getting the lessons to work. So I uploaded the completed lessons. I got some help with the errors from the teachers.
